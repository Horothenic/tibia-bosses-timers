# TIBIA BOSSES TIMER

These are reminders to myself to how to do stuff so I don't forget.

## IMPORT AUDIO ALARM
- Use a Macbook with Audacity.
- Recorded directly using Audacity.
- Increased its volume using `Effect/Volume and Compression/Amplify` with `15dB`.
- Name it same as the boss id.
- Add it to the repo sounds folder.
- Add the import to the `index.html`.

## UPLOAD GIF
- Get the gif from Tibia Wiki.
- Log in into `Cloudinary` using Github account.
- Upload file to the Tibia Bosses folder.
- Edit its name so it matches the boss id.
- Copy the url and use it on the boss list.
